Final Project

#This is a full-stack Task Management App where users can create, update, and manage tasks, projects, and groups with file uploads, authentication, and a responsive UI.

# The problem

#A lot of people including myself have task managing problems this app solves it with a vast array of methods. It also supports collaberation.

#The assignment was to build a complete full-stack application. I chose to create a task and project management system that supports collaboration, authentication, and file handling.

#I planned the project around scalability and user experience, using:

#Frontend: React (Vite) with Zustand for state management and Material-UI for accessible, responsive components.

Backend: Node.js + Express with MongoDB, GridFS for file storage, Multer for uploads, and JWT for authentication.

Deployment: Netlify (frontend) and Render (backend).

If I had more time, Iâ€™d add real-time updates (WebSockets), richer collaboration tools, and more advanced analytics dashboards.

Frontend: https://project-final-darius.netlify.app/

Key Highlights:

Frontend: React (Vite), Zustand for state management with persistence, Material-UI for responsive and accessible UI, Axios for API communication.

Backend: Node.js + Express with a RESTful API, MongoDB for storage, GridFS for file handling, Multer for uploads, and JWT for authentication.

Core Features:

Full task CRUD (create, update, delete, completion tracking).

Project management with automatic completion calculation.

Group management (create, join, leave, assign projects).

File uploads stored in MongoDB GridFS.

Filtering, search, and pagination support.

UX & Accessibility: Dark/light mode toggle, responsive layout, ARIA roles, modals, snackbars, and real-time state-driven updates.

Deployment: Frontend on Netlify, backend on Render.

What it demonstrates:

Proficiency in advanced state management (Zustand + persistence).

Secure authentication with JWT and protected API routes.

Scalable backend architecture with modular routes and file storage.

Strong focus on UX and accessibility through Material-UI and responsive design.

Readiness for future enhancements like real-time collaboration.
